# Inspiration 


Mother Earth has constantly faced difficulties due to human activities😔. The world is evolving every day, the growth in finance and technology is revolutionary and so are the pollution levels. The carbon emission in cities is reaching new heights every day. As more and more industries are being set up🏭, larger areas of forests are being cleared up. Afforestation is the need of the hour⏰. We need it to tackle the global issues humans👨 are facing. For example, global warming, soil erosion, pollution, the ecological imbalance is just some of the severe problems. We need measures like afforestation and reforestation to be practiced on a larger scale .

But with the busy modern lifestyle everyone is engrossed in 😫, negligible amount of people have time to plant a sapling and look after it as it grows. We wanted to tackle this problem by building a completely decentralized application which monitors everything 🧐.


# How is PlantPay different?

Unlike other sustainable development projects which are mostly non-profit,PlantPay has a unique concept of rewarding its users whenever they plant a tree with actual money🤑 .Users start out with zero streak count and their streak count increases based on the no.of trees the user is planting and taking care of.More the streaks, more the money!🔥We like to call it "Gamification of Nature"🎮🌻.

The users don't have to know about the trees they are going to plant.All they have to take a picture of the plant 📷 along with its leaves and the ML model does the job.It identifies the plant's family based on the pictures 🖼️ uploaded and the all the details are displayed.Its that simple !



# Problem it solves
* Nurturing nature: Simply planting the sapling 🌱 is not enough, we will be monitoring the well being of the plant too 🌳. Rewards will be given on the basis of the type of plant and its nurturing.
* Decentralised information 🔒: This helps in the accountability, improved traceability and transparency of the information. Further avoiding duplication of users for the sake of rewards.
* Survey for statistical data📈: The information will not be distorted and the maintenance cost will be low.Data is provided to low-investment data science based start-ups and companies📝.
* Identification of unknown plants 🔎: A machine learning model is included which identifies the family and species of different plants based on their leaves.

# Approach
The working of the application 📱📁 deals with the informationwhich will be stored in Ethereum blockchain ₿. The app design will be useful for  monitoring and analysing the plant data. It will also act as the interface for the extraction of data📊.There are optional survey forms included in the app which requires the user to fill in some general information.
The money generated from the surveys and will be further spent in the following ways, i.e.,  
* Maintenance of the application 
* Rewards for users planting a sapling and filling the form data. 
The app also includes a Machine learning based algorithm which classifies different plants based on their leaves so that users will not have the trouble to identify their plants and the family of the plant they want to grow.</br>
We also tried to give the users a smooth UI experience 💚✨💚:

# Challenges we faced

* Improving the accuracy for the machine learning model
* Collecting the data for training the model
* Turning ethereum into matic networks
* Collecting data from the forms

# What next 

* Inclusion of a self-updating Machine learning model which takes in the pictures of the plants uploaded and gets trained.
* Along with plant watering cycle, plant sorroundings can also be included for monitoring and streaks can be given for clean sorroundings.
